Notes: I want to apologize for this being late. I got home from class on 
Tuesday to find my internet was out. The way my bus runs I couldn't go back
to campus. It remained out through Wednesday. I am not asking for the lateness
to be excused. I merely want to make note of it.

Everything appears in working order if I go into /etc/hosts and set
sub1.brisuffety.com and sub2.brisuffety.com to the IP address listed above. 
I am still waiting for the records to propigate. I have been having trouble 
with iPage's service the past two weeks. Currently they have taken down my site
that is normally at brisuffety.com. 

In the A record screen shot you can see it says sub1 and sub2. This is what 
iPage's system automatically adjusts sub1.brisuffety.com and sub2.brisuffety.com to.
